# Scripting (Shell Script)

**Summary:**
A Scripting Language is a programming language which *interprets* rather than *compiles*, a series of commands into machine code as the script is run.

In this summary I would like to focus on the scripting language Shell Script.

**Shell Script:**              
Shell Script is a computer program run by a command line interpreter, it is used primarily for system administration such as file manipulation task automation and program execution.

**Data formats in**  .csv, .xls .html, .ods, .java, .py      
**Data formats out**  .csv, .xls .html, .ods, .java, .py

**Five tips:**  
1. Command line arguments such as mkdir, rmdir, mv and cp are some of the command used to manipulate files and directories.
2. Shell can be used to extract information from a file; cat, less, cut, grep are some of the commands to view, select or search for particular information.
3. < (input), > (output), | (piping) are some tools for combining file inputs, outputs and different commands.
4. For loops can be used to run commands multiple times
5. $@ can be used in a shell script to run command line argument variables.

**Examples of use:**        
Here is the use of a for loop an combination of tools

**Contribution to data analytics pipeline:**        
Shell Script can be used primarily in the processing and analysis phases of the data science pipeline (Combination of data manipulation tools provide a range of possibilities in working with data)

**Comment on your skill level:** 1 / 10                    
While I am aware of the several commands and tools available with Shell Script, my competence with the language is mediocre at best. When thinking about the two phases above, using Shell script is not the first thing which comes to mind. I would like to improve this by broadening my awareness around how to use Shell Script effectively.
