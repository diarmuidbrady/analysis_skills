# OpenRefine

**Summary:**                     
OpenRefine is very accessible program for data manipulation, providing you with the tools necessary for data cleaning, processing and transformation.

**Data formats in:**  .csv, .json, .tsv, .csv, .xls, .xlsx, json, .xml, .rdf                  
**Data formats out:**  .csv, .json, .tsv, .csv, .xls, .xlsx, json, .xml, .rdf

**Three tips:**
1.  OpenRefine can be used to validate dates, check whether they are in the same format or different formats
ie. mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy
2.  It possesses a powerful duplicate detection tool, it has different settings for different types of data
ie. Abbreviations DCU (Dublin City University)
3.  OpenRefine can perform operations on text or numbers using functions or transformations, with choice of languages (including python!)

**Examples of use:**               
Here I use a numeric facet to transform range to transform a facet

**Contribution to data analytics pipeline:**         
OpenRefine can be used primarily in the processing phase of the data science pipeline (Combination of data cleaning tools provide a range of possibilities to process data)

**Comment on your skill level:** 4 / 10              
OpenRefine is a very intuitive program and tool when given some small assistance. The fact that it uses python as one of its languages in data transformation is a bonus as I have adapted comfortably to it. What I would like to improve on is to simply explore further the tools available from OpenRefine.
