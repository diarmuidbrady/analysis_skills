# Git

**Summary:**                   
Git is a version control system, which allows multiple users to collaborate synchronously on a project together.

**Data formats in** .html, .css, .py, .r, .java, .txt, .csv    
**Data formats out** .html, .css, .py, .r, .java, .txt, .csv

**Treating file types**                      
Git uses algorithms to determine the type of a file.
If a text file contains really long lines and wide characters, it is treated as a binary file.

**Three tips:**
1. Commits are changes made to a repo/project. A history of these changes are kept on a log.
2. Branches are alternate versions of the work done on your project. This enables collaboration as changes on one branch will not interfere with another.
3. Before merging a branch with the rest of the project, you must make a pull request and resolve any conflicts which may arise

**Examples of use:**                           
https://github.com/nearmo, my own github account, where I display several personal and academic projects I have worked on.

**Contribution to data analytics pipeline:**                    
Git can contribute primarily to *Gathering* (storing datasets), *Analysis* (machine learning projects, git can be used for collaboration) and *Preserving* (data storage, maintenance and updates)

**Comment on your skill level:** 5 / 10                    
I have a working knowledge of git and github, I understand how to initialize, add to and remove files from, commit and push changes, make pull requests and resolve any conflicts which may arise merging a branch. I would like to learn more about working on several branches at once
