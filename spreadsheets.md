# Spreadsheets

**Summary:**                        
A spreadsheet program (Excel) is a tool which records and organizes data in a tabular fashion with rows and columns and can perform a multitude of operations for a single cell (row, column intersection) or a range.

**Data formats in:**  .csv, .txt, .ods, .xlsx, .xml, .dbf, .mdb     
**Data formats out:** .csv, .txt, .xlsx, .xml, .slk, .dif

**Three tips:**
1.  Simple basic math functions (+, -, *, /) can be performed on numbers as well as other statistical calculations mean(), stdev(), median()
2.  Operations can be performed on strings such as concatenate() to join strings together, or date() which can transform numbers into a date,
3.  Vlookup() is an advanced function for finding a specified value in a range

**Examples of use:**

**Contribution to data analytics pipeline:**              
Spreadsheets can be used in both the gathering (can be used for collecting the data from surveys), processing (its range of functions can be used to clean and process data), analysis (its statistical and graphical functions can be used to analyze datasets), presenting (there are many presentation tools in the forms of graphs and charts) and preserving (spreadsheets can be stored in csv files and then perhaps imported into a database or data warehouse).

**Comment on your skill level:**  3 / 10           
Spreadsheets are host to a range of powerful tools much of which I have not gained competence around nor been exposed to. I have yet to learn how to fully and effectively use spreadsheets however with practice and exposure this will come.
